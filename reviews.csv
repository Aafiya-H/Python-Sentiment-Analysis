1,1,1,"I liked about this hotel is location, food, ample parking space, cheaper cost.I disliked inside structure of building, freshness (good but not great), washrooms, etc. When you see washrooms, you feel like you are in a average hotel.",positive

3,3,3,"I stay with my family from 11-13 Dec 2010 adn have a few issues with the hotel.1) The first night was horrible. At 12mn, kids were shouting and making noises outside my room.I called reception to get security to come and do something and tried to sleep. No one came. After the third call almost 1 hour later to reception, security came and knock on a room 4 doors away which was full with 8-9 teens.It was then peace and quite. The rooms are not good soundproof and I could hear the telephone ringing everytime it goes off.2) we needed a shuttle to City provided by the hotel. The shuttle was full on sunday.There was only 10.30am shuttle in the morning. The hotel shld provide more shuttle service or mre frequent service during peak periods.We had to take a taxi instead.We were directed to a limousine counter. They said we were being upgraded to a hotel limousine. I thought that was good and had canceled my bad impression on the hotel. We were charged RM40. On the way back we took a taxi-RM30 only!. If the hotel were upgrading us it would have been RM30,when you charge us extra when I wanted a taxi, it is not an upgrade and is not acceptable.3) I needed a taxi to air hitam, the hotel told me I need to approach the limousine service. Again the girl charged me RM40. I told her yesterday to City was RM40 and now to air hitam it is RM40. She reduced to RM35 and that we were upgraded to a limousine. I told her I dont want a limo but taxi. She rudely told me if I wanted a taxi, I have to wait but she did not make any calls. I had to take the limo.On the whole It was a bad experience for our first time stay. It will be our last at Equatorial.There were some good expects. Its a good location hotel-quiet surrondings (but noisy rooms). The service was good and we enjoyed food at Kampachi and The Chinese rest. Coffe house was bad.There is fantastic gym. But too many bads",negative
