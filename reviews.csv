Friendly staff and quick service
Enjoyed the evening,	
,I liked about this hotel is location,, food,, ample parking space,, cheaper cost.I disliked inside structure of building,, freshness (good but not great),, washrooms,, etc. When you see washrooms,, you feel like you are in a average hotel.,	
,Nice hotel at Navi Mumbai,, location is very good. various sea food options are available.
